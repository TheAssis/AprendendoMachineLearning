# AprendendoMachineLearning
In this repo there are a lot of codes on the concept of *Machine Learning/ Deep Learning* and some related ideas. 

* */tensorflow_classes/*: in this folder there are the examples from the serie "[ML Zero to Hero](https://youtu.be/KNAWp2S3w94)", hosted by Laurence Moroney. It is a serie of 4 videos launched in the tensorflow youtube channel, and it aims to explain some concepts of Deep Neural Networks. 

* */machinelearningcrashcourse/*: in this folder there are (some of) the examples from the [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course), "Google's practical introduction to machine learning".

* */classmedley/*: during my studies, I've collected some examples in order to experiment some ideas, or even play around. Here they can be found. My huge thanks for the developers :) .

* */examples/*: more examples, just like the */classmedley/*.
