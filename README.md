# AprendendoMachineLearning
In this repo there are a lot of codes on the concept of *Machine Learning/ Deep Learning* and some related ideas. 

* */classmedley/*: during my studies, I've collected some examples in order to experiment some ideas, or even play around. Here they can be found. My huge thanks for the developers :) .

* */examples/*: more examples, just like the */classmedley/*. In this folder there are some skethces I've designed to the [lectures](https://github.com/ect-info/ml) of [Orivaldo Santana](https://github.com/orivaldosantana). Huge thanks to him and my coleagues!

* */kmeans/*: a cpp class for a [kmeans algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). It was designed as the last project for the [class](https://github.com/ect-info/ml). I has a lot of work to be done, as the algorithm is not complete.

* */machinelearningcrashcourse/*: in this folder there are (some of) the examples from the [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course), "Google's practical introduction to machine learning".

* */medleydata/*: data that I have no idea where it came from (ยบ.ยบ ~)

* */MIT6.S191/*: exercises for the [MIT Intro To Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) course. The labs can be found [here](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning_labs). Huge thanks to the team involved with the classes!

* */PaulGAllenSchool/*: Machine Learning classes hosted by professor Pedro Domingos. You can find it [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/UWCSE/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=16) and the material can be found [here for autumn class](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep546/17au/) and [here for spring class](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse446/15sp/).

* */perceptron/*: I tried to develop a C class of a perceptron. It's still incomplete :( .

* */tensorflow_classes/*: in this folder there are the examples from the serie "[ML Zero to Hero](https://youtu.be/KNAWp2S3w94)", hosted by [Laurence Moroney](https://github.com/lmoroney?tab=repositories). It is a serie of 4 videos launched in the tensorflow youtube channel, and it aims to explain some concepts of Deep Neural Networks.
