Hey There! During the studies, we often need more material than that provided.
In this file, I want to write down some material I needed to use an why.

2. _Decision Trees_

In order to understand _Information Gain_ I needed a practical example with some visual intuition. Please read Sam T Towards Data Science article: [Entropy: How Decision Trees Make Decisions](https://towardsdatascience.com/entropy-how-decision-trees-make-decisions-2946b9c18c8)

I've got some trouble trying to understand _Gain Ratio_ as well, but this [J. R. Quinlan Decision Trees and Multi-Valued Attributes](https://aitopics.org/download/classics:BEBDCE7E)) helped me a lot.

The probabilistic method for addressing _missing attribute values_ made me very confusing. The explanation used by Pedro Domingos in the video _8. Learning with Missing Values_ can be found in Mitchell _3.7.4 Handling Training Examples with Missing Attribute Values_. Going there, you're going to find a reference for Quinlan, 1993 (C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning) . The book can be found in ```/books/```. Go to chapter 3 and read Quinlan's explanation.
