Hey There! During the studies, we often need more material than that provided.
In this file, I want to write down some material I needed to use an why.

2. _Decision Trees_

In order to understand _Information Gain_ I needed a practical example with some visual intuition. Please read Sam T Towards Data Science article: [Entropy: How Decision Trees Make Decisions](https://towardsdatascience.com/entropy-how-decision-trees-make-decisions-2946b9c18c8)

I've got some trouble trying to understand _Gain Ratio_ as well, but this [J. R. Quinlan Decision Trees and Multi-Valued Attributes](https://aitopics.org/download/classics:BEBDCE7E)) helped me a lot.
